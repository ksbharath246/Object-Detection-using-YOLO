# Object-Detection-using-YOLO
Object Detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a computer vision project that leverages the YOLO algorithm to detect and localize objects within an image.

Dataset:
The coco dataset containing cat and dog images were used for this task. 

Training: 109 images were used for training. Refer Training folder for train dataset containing images and labels. Run the training.py file to start the training. 

Validation/Test: 21 images were used for vaidation. Refer Validation folder for valid dataset containing images and labels. Run the test.py file to start the training. 

Annotation:
Annotating the images with the bounding box is created manually using an online Opensource tool called Roboflow.

Output:
The outputimage.jpeg displays the detection for the test images.
